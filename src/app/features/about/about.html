        <h2>What is All The Tools?</h2>
        <p>
          All The Tools is a curated collection of front-end utility tools designed to help developers,
          designers, and content creators work more efficiently. Every tool runs entirely in your browser,
          ensuring your data remains private and secure.

        <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that powerful tools shouldn't come at the cost of your privacy. That's why every tool
          in our collection runs 100% client-side—no servers, no databases, no data collection. Your work
          stays on your device, where it belongs.
