The constant small interruptions were collapsing my mental stack dozens of times a day. The headphones smoothed out the chaos into a soft hum, letting me hold complex code in my head long enough to actually finish things. They also gave my family a clear signal - Dad\'s got the headphones on, so he\'s working. If you code in a shared space and keep thinking you\'re just slower than everyone else, maybe you\'re not.',
