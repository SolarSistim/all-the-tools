Not the loud kind, but the quiet, corrosive kind that can\'t stand seeing others enjoy what you\'ve given up on.',

You really are a heel
You're as cuddly as a cactus
You're as charming as an eel
Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
Mr. Grinch, with the greasy black peel

You're a vile one
You got termites in your smile
You have all the tender sweetness
Of a seasick crocodile
Mr. Grinch
You're a foul one
Friends you don't have none
I wouldn't touch you with a 39-and-a-half foot pole!

All them smiles, homie, I turn up the frown
All them decorations, I tear 'em down
You can ask Max, I don't play around
Ayo (eww)
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow? (Eww)
What you so mad for?
Halloween come around, and we ain't knockin' at your door, mane

Mr. Grinch, you're a bad banana
You're gonna spoil everybody with your bad attitude
(Spoil everybody)
Mr. Grinch

La-la-la-la
Who is this mean fellow
With his skin all green and his teeth all yellow?

What you so mad for?
Halloween come around, and we ain't knocking on your door

Bad banana`,
