The previous record was 3 inches, set during an era when people traveled by horse and buggy. Now, barely a year later, meteorologists are hedging their bets on whether the same region might see flurries again tomorrow, Sunday the 18th. If any accumulation happens, it would mark back-to-back winter seasons with measurable snow in a city where such events are supposed to happen maybe once or twice in a lifetime.',
